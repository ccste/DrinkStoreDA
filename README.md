## Project Details

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Questions:

1. What were the total sales amount, total expenses, and total number of orders for each store in different cities during the two year of 2016 and 2017?
2. What were the total sales amount and total sales quantity for all stores every month in 2016 and 2017?
3. Do males or females have a higher preference for purchasing drink products? What is the proportion of sales quantities corresponding to males and females?
4. What were the total sales amount for each product and each product category?

For a detailed breakdown of each KPI question, the visuals used to answer them, and the insights derived, please refer to the `Visualizations Research Report.docx`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Sales Amount Issue with Tea Category**: The tea category showed consistently low sales amounts. This was attributed to the limited variety within the tea category, with only Jasmine Tea being available.
2. **Sales Amount Issue in All Medium-sized Cities**: The sales performance in medium-sized cities was below expectations, with the combined sales amount in these cities accounting for only 31% of the total. This indicates a potential misalignment in product pricing for these cities.

### Conclusion & Action Plan:

- **Introduction of more variety** in the tea category to cater to diverse consumer preferences.
- **Discounts on tea category products** when purchasing from the milk tea category in all Gong Cha drink stores.
- **Reconsideration of pricing strategy** in medium-sized cities to encourage higher sales volumes.
